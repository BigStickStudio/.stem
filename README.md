# .stem
.stem is an idea for a new education platform, with the goal of replacing the worlds education systems.

## Controversy
How do we educate people without forcing them to learn a set curriculum?
How do you guarentee that people learn if they aren't required to?
How do you fund an education system that doesn't have teachers?
How do you regulate curriculum if you allow people to learn whatever they want?

## Problem-Solution
The current education systems force children to learn things that they fail to see the relevance of, or are not interested in learning. Instead of teaching them how to learn, this teaches them that they do not want to learn, and destroys individual self-confidence - and thus creates a sense of learned helplessness. It also creates distrust in society as children feel misunderstood, neglected, and like the system was not designed to serve them - because it wasn't. When they engage with the content in a relevant context, they experience cognitive dissonance, because they have already learned that they do not want to learn, or worse have been taught not to care.

The solution is to allow children to learn what they want when they want. People are naturally curious, and naturally gravitate towards things that interest them. This will encourage people to self-motivate by allowing them to pursue things that they are naturally passionate about.

This system would cultivate a community based learning system where individuals have all of the resources, information, and offers a peer group of fellow individuals to allow them to learn anything that interests them as fast as they want, or can.. and would cultivate relationships with people who are on the same learning path, as well as connecting them with mentors in their circle.

As a result, by learning things that interest them, they will develop a greater sense of self confidence, and a deeper passion and understanding for the things that interest them. This will drive more learning, understanding and innovation, In a group aspect, this will establish them as part of a community of people who share similar interests, which will drive more interest, innovation and research, and passion. 

These systems can be incentivized by tracking progress, establishing rank, and even opening opportunities for research and development projects, grants, and certificate programs. Individuals can become self-established experts by progressing through a given set of curriculum defined by the community in which they are learning.

Each school of thought will be given their own subdomain (e.g. `math.stem` or even `trig.math.stem`) where the community will be allowed to define their own curriculum, experts, research and resource materials. This promotes community engagement as well as ongoing research and development, and also defines subject-matter-experts in a given community, as well as allowing for communities to self-moderate. These accomplishments will also be incorporated into a users profile to establish a level of expertise in a given field - which aids in an individuals portfolio, and thus creates more opportunity for personal growth in terms of education and career opportunities.

By building a system with a foundation as such, when individuals study art, they will also eventually be studying history, and when learning about history in a relevant context - they will develop a more meaningful and deep understanding of the content, as opposed to current systems which subconsciously create a sense of drear and dread.

## Mechanics
The platform will need to operate in a context similar to a social media platform, as well as a chat platform.. like a hybrid between Discord, Reddit and LinkedIn.

There needs to be mechanisms for peer-to-peer connections, as well as individual-to-group engagements in terms of learning, collaboration, and research.

College and Certificate programs need to be integrated in a way that individual learning paths are not defined solely by a given school or program, but where the individual is allowed to follow a college or certificate program, and it contribute to the individuals learning path within a given community. We are already seeing this with free-opensource learning programs like OSSU, which incorporates Harvard, Princeton and Yale curriculum.. but does not entitle you to a degree with those programs, unless you sign up and complete those programs as well.

There needs to be mechanism for individuals to earn points in a community as they engage with and help others.. as well as opportunities for individuals to be a part of research programs, which would allow for grants, private funding, etc.

Advertisements will obviously need to be a part of the platform.

No *.stem domain should be allowed to exist unless it is specifically under the school of *.stem platform requirements, except for peer.stem which is the top level social media platform.

Proprietary and Open-Source projects need to be able to be integrated, with each school being able to integrate with their own external sources/domains/content.. e.g. many programmers use github, while many artists may use other external portfolio management tools or services. The platform needs to be plug-and-play in a similar way to shopify integrations.

Security measures are crucial .. see: `cs.cs.stem` or `sec.cs.stem` for cybersecurity.computerscience.stem

## Target Market
Initially we should try and engage with computer science researches, self-learners, and kids who are learning faster than school can teach them. Discord is a hub for this sort of demographic. We would need to garner support from online learning platforms, specifically colleges and certificate programs. Initially we could allow peer.stem to reflect educators portfolios, to allow them to share their content, and quickly should pivot towards garnering support of development and research teams that are using platforms like IRC and Discord for proprietary services.
